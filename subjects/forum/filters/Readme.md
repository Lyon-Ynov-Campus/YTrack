## forum-filters
### Objectives

You must follow the same [principles](https://public.01-edu.org/subjects/forum/) as the first subject.

You need to implement a filter mechanism, that will allow users to filter the displayed posts by :

    - filter by categories (if implemented)

This project will help you learn about:

- Manipulation, display and storage of data

### Instructions

- The backend must be written in **Go**.
- You must handle website errors.
- The code must respect the [good practices](https://public.01-edu.org/subjects/good-practices/)
- It is recommended that the code should present a **test file**.

### Allowed packages

- Only the [standard go](https://golang.org/pkg/) packages are allowed
