### Objectives
In this project you will create a browser-based game inspired by Osu! and Frets on Fire.

### Getting started
You will need to create a public repository with the name `rhythm-frenzy`.

### Core features
- You will use a `requestAnimationFrame` recursive loop.
- HTML elements are created automatically at random intervals and move.
- When a key is pressed or a click, an element will be destroyed
- A line will be drawn using HTML, if the key is pressed when the element touches the line the element's color will change to green, else it will change to red.
- The controls must be displayed one way or another. An explenation on how to play the game is needed.
- Element emit a sound when destroyed at the right time
- CHOOSE: 
    - The game has a certain duration. The score is calculated depending on how many elements have been destroyed at the right time. In the other hand the score reduces<br><br>
    **OR**
    <br><br>
    - The game can speed up overtime. The score is calculated depending on how many elements have been destroyed at the right time. In the other hand the game stops

### Bonuses
- Elements appear on different zones, each zone is associated to a different key
- Let the user choose which controls he wants to set.
- The score can grow more and more depending on how accurate you are when destroying the element
- Element emit a different sound depending of the column they are destroyed
- Elements can be of different height or radius

### Example
- Inspired by Guitar Hero or Frets on Fire
